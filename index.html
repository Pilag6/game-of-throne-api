<!-- Your Task
Create a Single Page Application (SPA) that displays houses, people and quotes from the series Game
of Thrones (GOT). The API https://api.gameofthronesquotes.xyz can be used for this. The following
features should be implemented:
- In the navigation area, the items "Houses", " Persons", "Quotes" should be present
- A searchable list of all houses from GOT should be displayed under "Houses". If you click on the
name of a house, the members of that house are displayed on a subpage.
- A searchable list of all persons from GOT, including the associated house, should be displayed
under "Persons". If you click on the name of a person, details about this person are displayed on
a subpage (name, house, quotations).
- Furthermore, there should be a button that replaces the list of quotations of this person with
other quotations.
- In the "Quotes" section, there is a list of five quotes by default. The user can use a button to
replace this list with five other random quotes.
- As there are references in the API to the other entities for all houses, persons and quotations,
links to the respective entity should be included in the individual lists.
- As a frontend developer you should put at least some effort to a nice look and feel.
